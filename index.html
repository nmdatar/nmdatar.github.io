        <p>I'm a software engineer and aspiring researcher interested in maximizing safety, 
          reliability, and efficiency of AI systems. I'm currently studying CS and Statistics at Harvard.
        </p>

        <p>In the past, I've worked on improving customer metrics visibility at AWS Route 53 and 
          deep learning for chest x-ray interpretation with Pranav Rajpurkar at Harvard Medical School.
          This summer, I'll be interning at Nuro, where I'll be working on data discovery for the AI platform. 
          I'm excited to learn more about autonomous driving and the world of physical AI!
